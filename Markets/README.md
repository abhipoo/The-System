A. Entities
1. Company (A publicly listed or private organization / entity)
- Company name

- Current share price

2. Product (A thing that is either consumed by a company as raw material or produced by a company as finished product. For example: Steel is produced by steel companies, and consumed by car companies)

- Inflation rate
5b. GDP
- GDP growth rate

B. Relation between entities
1. A company consumes natural resources and products as raw materials.
2. Companies are connected by virtue of products.

- Advantages of modeling this system / What questions can this system answer ?
1. To understand emergent behaviors of markets - Patterns that are seen more than 90% of times. For example: If price of crude oil increases, margins reduce for these companies.
2.  Relationship between behaviors - Example: If margins decrease, there is a 90% chance that stock prices will decrease.

- Who will be users of this system ?
1. Learners: For people who want to learn macroeconomics interactively.
2. Investors: Visualize macroeconomic conditions and bet on companies that are probable to perform good because of these macroeconomic conditions.
3. Establish correlation between industries / companies and factors - Example: Correlation between rise in crude oil prices on the paint industry stock prices.
